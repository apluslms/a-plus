THIS INSTALLATION GUIDE IS WRITTEN FOR SETTING UP A+ IN UBUNTU, APACHE AND MOD_WSGI
===================================================================================

Python 2.7 is required

It is recommended to use virtualenv (http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/). Run the venv_bootstrap.py script to
create a virtualenv and bootstrap it with all the required python libraries:
$ python venv_bootstrap.py /path/to/virtualenv

Alternatively, you can install the required libraries without virtualenv or in a pre-existing virtualenv:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Create local_settings.py in the same directory with settings.py and override necessary Django settings. At least
BASE_URL and SECRET_KEY must be set in case of deployment.

If using SQLite, make sure that the file itself and the aaltoplus
folder are writeable by the Apache user (www-data?).
