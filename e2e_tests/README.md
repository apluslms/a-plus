# Creating tests

1. Run A+ locally using the [develop-aplus](https://github.com/apluslms/develop-aplus) repository
```
source .venv/bin/activate
./docker-up.sh
```

2. Begin "recording" a test in the browser
```
playwright codegen --target python-pytest "localhost:8000/?hl=en"
```

3. Copy the generated test code to a Python file
