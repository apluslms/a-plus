Course and exercise configuration
=================================

## Configuration files

Configuration is written as JSON or YAML inside subdirectories.
Each subdirectory holding an `index.json` or `index.yaml` is a
valid active course.

Dates will be parsed as '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S',
'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M', '%Y-%m-%d %H' or '%Y-%m-%d'.
Durations are given in (int)(unit), where units are y, m, d, h or w.

		for submissions (in bytes). The limit is checked for each file separately if
		there are multiple files in a submission. Set zero for no limit.
		Default value is 1048576 (1 MB). Moodle has sitewide configuration for
		the maximum upper limit which cannot be exceeded.
	* `personalized`: (optional) if true, personalized exercise instances must
		be pregenerated and each user is then assigned an instance of the exercise
	* `generated_files`: (required if personalized) set a list of generated files
		for a personalized exercise. Each list item defines the following settings:
		* `file`: filename of the generated file
		* `key`: key for accessing the file in HTML templates

		   the generated file
		* `content_in_template`: if true, template variable includes the content
		   of the generated file
		* `allow_download`: if true, the generated file can be downloaded from the web
	* `generator`: (required if personalized) settings for the generator program that
		creates one new instance of the exercise. At least `cmd` must be set.
		* `cmd`: command line as an ARRAY that is used to run the generator.
			Mooc-grader appends the instance directory path to the argument list and
			the generator is expected to write files into the directory. The file names
			should be listed under `generated_files` setting so that mooc-grader is aware
			of them. The Django command used to pregenerate exercises is
			`python manage.py pregenerate_exercises course_key <exercise_key>`
			(`--help` option prints all possible arguments).
		* `cwd`: if set, this sets the current working directory for the generator
			program. Start the path from the course directory (course key as the
			first directory).
	* `max_submissions_before_regeneration`: (optional, only usable in personalized exercises)

		regenerated (the exercise instance is changed to another one). If unset,
		the exercise is never regenerated.

	Rest of the attributes are exercise type specific.

3. ### course_key/sandbox
	A directory for sandbox environment content. Directory is copied into
	sandbox as `/usr/local/sandbox/course_key`. In a sandbox action the
	executables are automatically in the command path. Files beginning with
	`install-` will be run inside the sandbox in alphabetical order during the
	`manage_sandbox.sh` run. Before that the `scripts/sandbox` and the selected
	`scripts/sandbox_available` install files are run.

4. ### course_key/sandbox/from_sandbox_available
	List required files from `scripts/sandbox_available` each name at one line.

	Rest of the attributes are action type specific.

### Action types

Common test actions are implemented in `grader.actions` and they should
fit most purposes by configuration. However, it is possible to implement a
course specific test actions in a course_key.actions Python module. Typically
the actual tests should be written as programs or scripts run inside the safe
sandbox system.

1. ### grader.actions.prepare
	Does preparations on the submitted files. Additional attributes:
	* `attachment_pull` (optional): a TARGET file path to pull
		*user/exercise_attachment* from *acceptAttachedExercise* view

		files from any recognized character sets they are in
	* `cp_exercises` (optional): a space separated list of *path->path* where
		source path is relative to exercise configuration e.g.
		`exercise_dir->user` would copy contents of
		*exercises/course_key/exercise_dir* into the submission *user*
		directory.
	* `cp` (optional): a space separated list of *path->path* where both paths
		are relative to submission root e.g. `model/lib->user/lib` would
		replicate the lib directory among the user submitted files.
	* `mv` (optional): a space separated list of *path->path* where
		both paths are relative to submission root e.g.
		`user/file_name->user/new_dir/file_name`
	* `cp_generated`: (only in personalized exercises)
		a space separated list of *path->path* where the source path
		is relative to the generated exercise instance assigned to the user and
		the destination path is relative to the submission root. E.g.,
		`seed->user/seed` copies a generated file `seed` into the submission
		directory (assume that the exercise generator creates a file called `seed`).
	* `cp_personal`: (only in personalized exercises)
		a space separated list of *path->path* where the source path
		is relative to the user's personal directory and the destination path is
		relative to the submission root. E.g., `somefile->user/somefile`
		copies a personal file `somefile` to the submission directory.

	**Note** that the cp/mv *path->path* pattern does not replicate shell
	command arguments. Either dir->dir contents or individual file->file is
	inserted creating new parent directories if required.

2. ### grader.actions.sandbox
	Executes a command inside the chroot sandbox as a restricted user.
	Picks points from `TotalPoints: N` and/or `MaxPoints: N` lines if
	printed out. Additional attributes:

	* `files` (optional): limit the number of file descriptors the command can
		open
	* `disk` (optional): limit the disk bytes the command can write, use 10k
		for kilobytes and 10m for megabytes

3. ### grader.actions.sandbox_python_test
	Executes a command that should run a Python unittest inside the chroot
	sandbox as a restricted user. This is identical to the normal sandbox
	action except that the stderr (unittest output) is presented as stdout and
	the real stdout is nulled. Note that at the end of the complete test run
	(e.g. def tearDownClass) the `TotalPoints: N` and `MaxPoints: N` lines
	should be printed out.

4. ### grader.actions.gitlabquery

5. ### grader.actions.gitclone
	Works with the *acceptGitAddress* view type. Tries to clone the
	repository. Additional attributes:

	* `model_dir` (optional): default `model`
	* `user_dir` (optional): default `user`
	* `xslt_transform` (optional): a name of an XSL style file for
		transforming expaca XML output e.g. `expaca/xsl/aplus-utf8.xsl`

7. ### grader.actions.store_user_files
	Stores files from the submission directory to the user's personal directory.
	This can be used to store grading output files for future use in grading.
	Requires that the exercise is personalized and the project settings have
	enabled personal directories (`settings.ENABLE_PERSONAL_DIRECTORIES`)
	(so that the personal directory exists).
	* `cp`: a space separated list of *path->path* where the source path is
		relative to the submission root and the destination is relative to the
		personal directory of the user. E.g., `user/someoutput->output` stores
		`someoutput` to `output` file in the personal directory of the user.

## Default sandbox scripts

Following common scripts are provided by default and copied into the sandbox.
However, the common scripts may have sandbox install requirements that are not
met by default. Both the /usr/local/sandbox and /usr/local/sandbox/course_key
are in the sandbox execution path and may be included in sandbox command line.

3. ### virtualenv.sh envname cmd [arguments..]
	Activates the named Python virtualenv and passes rest for a command.

4. ### template.sh
	An example of a grading shell script. Will list submission files and
	always grade 10/10 points.

## Templates

exercise directory and use subdirectories. The available variables are
listed below.

1. ### All templates
	* `course`: course configuration dictionary
	* `exercise`: exercise configuration dictionary
	* If the exercise is personalized and the exercise settings include
		`generated_files`:
		* `generated_files`: dictionary with the keys defined in the settings,
			for each key there is the value for `file`, and with the enabled
