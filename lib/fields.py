class SearchSelectField(forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField):
    """
    A generic form field for the AplusSearchSelectAjax jQuery plugin, i.e.,
    a form HTML widget that queries the API and supports selecting multiple
    values from the search results. The JavaScript code is in the file
    assets/js/ajax_search_select.js.

    This field is mostly the same as the parent class ModelMultipleChoiceField.
    It can be used with ModelForms when the model's ManyToManyField has so
    many values that a normal select-multiple HTML widget would be unusable.
    For example, selecting users from thousands of options would be infeasible
    for the user.

    The constructor has a new argument initial_queryset that is used to render
    choices in the HTML select element instead of using queryset for that.
    Queryset is still used for validating the user input. Initial_queryset is
    used to supply the initial selection to the JavaScript code so that it can
    be rendered on page load. Initial_queryset must not include any other
    choices so that the size of the HTML page does not grow too much.
    This field class and the JS code were designed to be used with user fields
    when the database has thousands of users. Including all users in the options
    of the HTML select element would slow down the page load.

    When you use this field in a form class, you must also define the queryset
    and initial_queryset arguments for this field. They can be set in the form
    constructor if they depend on the form constructor parameters.
    Furthermore, the HTML data attributes for the widget must be set
    (usually in the form constructor). Check the documentation for the Javascript
    code (assets/js/ajax_search_select.js).

        to only the initially selected values of the model field, i.e.,
        the old value of the model field so that the form can render the
        initial selection without including massive amounts of data
        (all valid choices) in the HTML page. The initial_queryset does not
        restrict the user's choices since the widget queries the API for new
